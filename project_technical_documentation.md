# Project Technical Documentation

## Project Overview
This project is a simple software application created for educational purposes.
The main goal of the project is to demonstrate basic programming logic,
system structure, and proper technical documentation.

The project processes user input, applies basic validation and logic,
and produces an output based on the implemented functionality.

---

## System Architecture
The system is designed as a simple standalone application.

Main components:
- User interface (input and output)
- Application logic module
- Data processing layer

The user interacts with the application, which processes the data
and returns the result to the user.

---

## Technology Stack
- Programming language: (e.g. Java / Python / JavaScript)
- Development environment: Visual Studio Code
- Version control: Git, GitHub
- Operating system: Windows

---

## Application Flow
1. The user starts the application.
2. The user provides input data.
3. The system validates the input.
4. The application processes the data according to the implemented logic.
5. The result is displayed to the user.
6. The application terminates.

---

## Build and Run Pipeline
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
3. Run the application using the appropriate command
   (for example: `java Main.java` or `python main.py`).
4. Observe the output in the console or user interface.

## Future Improvements
- Improve input validation
- Add error handling
- Extend functionality
- Improve user interface
